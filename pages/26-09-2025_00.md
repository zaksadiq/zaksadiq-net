# The Ramifications and Mathematics of Intra-Spacetime Energetic Dynamics

## Introduction

If you take energy to be the felt emotional experience that permeates our subjective experience, and also a fluid like substance that permeates space, made of information of concepts which are materialised in the world, as described by language; you can then make the step towards defining energetic dynamics as the exchange and trades and dynamics of mutual influence by parties in an interaction. You can then make a further step to denote interactions of energetic dynamics as occurring across space and time when records are viewed, modelling them also as interactions, because viewing an old letter, or watching a film can change our felt emotional experience. The idea that we are interacting across time this way, then does raise some questions - does this work as a theory?

## Ramifications

If a record is viewed in the future multiple times, then this creates a one-many relationship between the originating interaction party and the
