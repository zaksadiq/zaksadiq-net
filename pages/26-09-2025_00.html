        Dynamics</h1>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>If you take energy to be the felt emotional experience that
        permeates our subjective experience, and also a fluid like
        substance that permeates space, made of information of concepts
        which are materialised in the world, as described by language;
        you can then make the step towards defining energetic dynamics
        as the exchange and trades and dynamics of mutual influence by
        parties in an interaction. You can then make a further step to
        denote interactions of energetic dynamics as occurring across
        space and time when records are viewed, modelling them also as
        interactions, because viewing an old letter, or watching a film
        can change our felt emotional experience. The idea that we are
        interacting across time this way, then does raise some questions
        - does this work as a theory?</p>
        <h2 id="ramifications">Ramifications</h2>
        <p>If a record is viewed in the future multiple times, then this
        creates a one-many relationship between the originating
