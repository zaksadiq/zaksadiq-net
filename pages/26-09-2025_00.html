        Ramifications and Mathematics of Intra-Spacetime Energetic
        Dynamics</h1>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>If you take energy to be the felt emotional experience that
        permeates our subjective experience, and also a fluid like
        substance that permeates space, made of information of concepts
        which are materialised in the world, as described by language;
        you can then make the step towards defining energetic dynamics
        as the exchange and trades and dynamics of mutual influence by
        parties in an interaction. You can then make a further step to
        denote interactions of energetic dynamics as occurring across
        space and time when records are viewed, modelling them also as
        interactions, because viewing an old letter, or watching a film
        can change our felt emotional experience. The idea that we are
        interacting across time this way, then does raise some questions
        - does this work as a theory?</p>
        <h2 id="ramifications">Ramifications</h2>
        <p>If a record is viewed in the future multiple times, then this
        creates a one-many relationship between the originating
        interaction party and the future interaction parties. How does
        this work?</p>
        <h3 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h3>
        <p>The first hypothesis we can use is that the originating
        interaction party has their energy modified as an average of all
        future parties.</p>
        <p>The second hypothesis we can use is that in some way the
        originating person’s energy fate is tied with the future
        interaction parties, and that the future parties simply “get
        their energy back” at the time of viewing the record in the
        future. - This second hypothesis is a non-direct interaction,
        more of a “return of soul parts”.</p>
