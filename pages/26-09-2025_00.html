        and Mathematics of Intra-Spacetime Energetic Dynamics</h1>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>If you take energy to be the felt emotional experience that
        permeates our subjective experience, and also a fluid like
        substance that permeates space, made of information of concepts
        which are materialised in the world, as described by language;
        you can then make the step towards defining energetic dynamics
        as the exchange and trades and dynamics of mutual influence by
        parties in an interaction. You can then make a further step to
        denote interactions of energetic dynamics as occurring across
        space and time when records are viewed, modelling them also as
        interactions, because viewing an old letter, or watching a film
        can change our felt emotional experience. The idea that we are
        interacting across time this way, then does raise some questions
        - does this work as a theory?</p>
        <h2 id="ramifications">Ramifications</h2>
        <p>If a record is viewed in the future multiple times, then this
        creates a one-many relationship between the originating
        interaction party and the future interaction parties. How does
        this work?</p>
        <h3 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h3>
        <p>The first hypothesis we can use is that the originating
        interaction party (the creator of the record) has their energy
        modified as an average of all future parties:</p>
        <p><span class="math display">$$
        \frac{1}{N}\displaystyle\sum_{p=1}^N (C_e, C_i, C_f)
        $$</span></p>
        <p>This shows an average of the energy vectors of each
        non-orginating party, where the energy vector of each
        non-originating party consists of three components: <span
        class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>e</em></sub></span> is
        the emotional component of energy (as felt), <span
        class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is
        the informational component of energy of the concepts being
        materialised (as described by language), and <span
        class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span> is
        the fluid component of energy (as linked to our breath); and p
        represents the iterator variable for the current non-originating
        interaction party.</p>
        <p>The second hypothesis we can use uses a different paradigm -
        one of soul parts exchanged through the world. In this second
        hypothesis we say that the non-originating interaction party
        gave their soul-part away and then got it back at a later date:
        when they interacted via the record in the future. In this
        hypothesis their soul-part may have even possibly been traded
        away from the original person they gave it to, to other
        third-parties, until it eventually ended up with the originating
        party who produced the record.</p>
        <h3 id="complexifying">Complexifying</h3>
        <p>The soul-part traded in the second hypothesis may not even be
        finally given to the originating interaction party before ending
        up with the final interaction party viewing the record in the
        future; it could have been traded to someone involved in the
        broader eco-system of the interaction, that is, for example,
        with those involved in the publishing of the record, or those
        who produced the technology that the record was transmissed over
        / viewed using.</p>
