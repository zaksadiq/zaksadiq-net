                <ol>
                    <li>'Write': Producing refined artefacts exhibiting a high standard and quality, and those qualities which may be regarded as most desireable, particularly those which surround taste, elegance, timelessness, ... .</li>
                    <li>'Read': Seeking those artefacts of other authors which embody these requirements, as representing areas and authors to become engrossed in and to consume excessively as a pastime and as work to improve my craft, upon those 'right-feeling' items being found.</li>
                </ol>
            </span>
            <span>This pertains to writings of different classes: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Scientific/Academic, Software, to name a few (these may overlap). Writing is taken in the view of writing as a synthesis and expression of information by intelligence in written form (definition to be improved), and so is not to be understood as limited by the limited definition of the craft of writing, but instead a broader art of any subject-field and any intelligent organisation of information, with writing being an origin point for any subject of study to take place.</span>

        <h2>Currently Reading</h2>
        <div>
            <span>Currently I am reading, where reading produces the necessary input of information for me to absorb, for improvement & development, and provides a degree of enjoyment and awe in the splendour of beauty:</span>
            <h3>Fiction</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>War and Peace (Antony Briggs Translation)</li>
                <li>Crime and Punishment (Pevear and Volokhonsky Translation)</li>
                <li>Pride and Prejudice (Wordsworth Classics Copy)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Non-Fiction</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering - Richard Hamming </li>
                <li>Spinoza's 'Ethics': An Introduction - Steven Nadler</li>
                <li>Ethics - Spinoza</li>
            </ol>
            <span>I like to listen to Spotify's 'Reading Soundtrack' playlist whilst ingesting these.</span>
        </div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>In the background of my life I seem to be learning about creating high quality artefacts and doing things very well (as a "craftsman" at art in writing as the organisation of information by intelligence.) Primarily this is by reading at present (above).</p>
        <p>I hope to discover some wonderful, refined writings with which to dedicate my life and time.</p>
        <p>I am currently following the University of Oxford's News section.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>War and Peace (Antony Briggs Translation) Translator's Note - This item felt particularly good to read, although unfortunately further writings of this kind could not be found upon a search of the author's name - as a lesser substitute, I may have to read all of his translations.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <h2>Professional Development</h2>
        <h3>I am working my way through the book:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The Rust Programming Language - Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, Chris Krycho</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>I intend to brush up on, getting certificates in:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Linear Algebra</li>
            <li>Multi-variable Calculus</li>
            <li>Differential Equations</li>
            <li>Word embeddings + AI mathematics</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Traditional Engineering</h2> 
        <p>I get curious about the conceptual tools gained through a aerospace / mechanical engineering course (mathematics, fluids, thermodynamics, materials, ...) which I could use if learned, although I do not currently allocate my free time towards working through these subjects. </p>
        <!-- <p>I have an interest in aerospace engineering component design and production and materials. Unfortunately I do not get time to work on learning a little about these fields as a hobbyist. I always think when using a coffee machine or riding a train: "I have the principles to make a basic/crude version of this - and could make it with a bit of research, time, and resources" (whilst still respecting the maturation of how developed these things can be and how educated the engineers designing and those implementing them are), and would very much like to code a coffee machine's software (perhaps my next project).</p> -->
        <!-- <p>I get curious about the mathematics and conceptual tools I am missing out having not properly got through a full traditional engineering course.</p> -->
        <h2>Blog</h2>
        <p>This website supports Markdown blogs with Latex maths.</p>
        <p>Note: These writings are currently unavailable.</p>

        <h2>Other</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I am a big fan of the OED, although I do not use it regularly (I recommend reading about why it is super.)</li>
            <li>I plan to work on a metaphysical simulation engine, having worked on turning new metaphysics into a metaphysical science and engineering field as an exercise in the foundations of science and knowledge, and an art form in the beauty of reality and life, including social life. Really it's building a better model of reality, which is then used to create a simulation.</li>
