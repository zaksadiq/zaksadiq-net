                <ol>
                    <li>Producing refined artefacts exhibiting a high standard and quality, and those qualities which may be regarded as most desireable, particularly those which surround taste, elegance, timelessness, decency, ... .</li>
                    <li>Seeking those artefacts of other authors which embody these requirements, as representing areas and authors to become engrossed in and to consume excessively as a pastime and as work to improve craft, upon those 'right-feeling' items being found.</li>

            </span>
            <span>This pertains to writings of different classes: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Scientific/Academic, to name a few (these may overlap); although may involve other creative products on ocassion such as software. At this stage writing is taking a front-seat, although is taken in the view of writing as a synthesis and expression of information by the intelligence in written form (definition to be improved), and so is not to be understood as limited by the limited definition of the craft of writing, but instead a broader art of any subject-field and any intelligent organisation of information, with writing being an origin point for any subject of study to take place - incidentally, and this was not the intention of it being said, this definition also means the craft of software can be viewed as writing (or the pursuit of any subject of study, too, if you like).</span>

            <span>Currently I am reading, where reading produces the necessary input of information for me to absorb for improvement, and provides a degree of enjoyment and awe in the splendour of beauty:</span>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Research into high quality artefacts.</p>
        <p>Currently I am following the University of Oxford's News section, reading this for the University is seen by me as a suitable example for how to conduct oneself intellectually.</p>

                <li>Translator's Note (Section in War and Peace (Antony Briggs Translation)) - This item felt particularly good to read, although unfortunately further writings of this kind could not be found upon a search of the author's name - as a lesser substitute, I may have to read all of his translations.</li>
