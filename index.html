                    <li>'Write': Producing refined artefacts exhibiting a high standard and quality, and those qualities which may be regarded as most desireable, particularly those which surround taste, elegance, timelessness, ... .</li>
                    <li>'Read': Seeking those artefacts of other authors which embody these requirements, as representing areas and authors to become engrossed in and to consume excessively as a pastime and as work to improve my craft, upon those 'right-feeling' items being found.</li>
                </ol>
            </span>
            <span>This pertains to writings of different classes: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Scientific/Academic, Software, to name a few (these may overlap). Writing is taken in the view of writing as a synthesis and expression of information by intelligence in written form (definition to be improved), and so is not to be understood as limited by the limited definition of the craft of writing, but instead a broader art of any subject-field and any intelligent organisation of information, with writing being an origin point for any subject of study to take place.</span>

        <div>
            <span>Currently I am reading, where reading produces the necessary input of information for me to absorb, for improvement & development, and provides a degree of enjoyment and awe in the splendour of beauty:</span>
            <h3>Fiction</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>War and Peace (Antony Briggs Translation)</li>
                <li>Crime and Punishment (Pevear and Volokhonsky Translation)</li>
                <li>Pride and Prejudice (Wordsworth Classics Copy)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Non-Fiction</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering - Richard Hamming</li>
                <li>Spinoza's 'Ethics': An Introduction - Steven Nadler</li>
                <li>Ethics - Spinoza</li>
            </ol>
            <span>I listen to Spotify's 'Reading Soundtrack' playlist whilst ingesting these.</span>
        </div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Research in creating high quality artefacts and doing things <span class="italics">very</span> well (as a "craftsman" at art in writing as organisation of information by intelligence.) Primarily this is by reading (see above).</p>
        <p>Currently I am following the University of Oxford's News section.</p>
        <p>I admire the work of <a href="https://github.com/derlin">Lucy "Derlin" Linder</a></p>

            <ul>
                <li>War and Peace (Antony Briggs Translation) Translator's Note - This item felt particularly good to read, although unfortunately further writings of this kind could not be found upon a search of the author's name - as a lesser substitute, I may have to read all of his translations.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Other</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I am a big fan of the OED, although I do not use it regularly (I recommend reading about why it is super.)</li>
            <li>I work on turning new metaphysics into a metaphysical science and engineering field as an exercise in the foundations of science and knowledge, and an art form in the beauty of reality and life, including social life. Perhaps one day it will have some use.</li>
